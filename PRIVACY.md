# IP Kit Privacy Policy
IP Kit promises that no other data is collected other than timing and request load metrics.
None of the input data is archived or exposed to third parties.
In the case async delivery is requested by the client, given IP address and callback URL are queued and stored temporarily
until a background worker completes processing of the request and ships the results to the callback.
